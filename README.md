## Example

## API

### `_registerForOperatorFiltering`
```solidity 
function _registerForOperatorFiltering(
    address subscriptionOrRegistrantToCopy, 
    bool subscribe
) internal virtual
````
Registration function that can be called in an initializer, anywhere.  

Can be called repeatedly without issues.

To subscribe to the [default OpenSea curated block list](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/operator-filter-registry/#deployments), simply use `_registerForOperatorFiltering()`, without arguments.

### `onlyAllowedOperator`
```solidity
modifier onlyAllowedOperator(address from, bool enabled) virtual
```  
Modifier to guard a function and revert if `from` is a blocked operator.  

Can be turned on / off via `enabled`.

For efficiency, you can use tight variable packing to efficiently read / write the boolean value for `enabled`.

### `onlyAllowedOperatorApproval`
```solidity
modifier onlyAllowedOperatorApproval(address operator, bool enabled) virtual
```  
Modifier to guard a function from approving a blocked operator.  

Can be turned on / off via `enabled`.

For efficiency, you can use tight variable packing to efficiently read / write the boolean value for `enabled`.
