Gas optimized and flexible version of OpenSea's Mandatory Operator Filterer for royalties.

## Features

- `modifier onlyAllowedOperator(address from, bool filterEnabled)`  
   modifier that allows conditional toggling of the filter.  

   You can passed in a bool extracted from a packed variable for `filterEnabled`.

- `_registerForOperatorFiltering(address subscriptionOrRegistrantToCopy, bool subscribe)`

   Registration function that can be called in an initializer, anywhere.  

   Can be called repeatedly without issues.

- `_registerForOperatorFiltering()` 

   Registration function similar to above. Uses OpenSea's default block list. 

- Gas optimized. Saves 1500+ gas on transfers.

- Keeps your cilents and some marketplaces happy.
