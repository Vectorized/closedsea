## API

### `_registerForOperatorFiltering`
```solidity 
function _registerForOperatorFiltering(
    address subscriptionOrRegistrantToCopy, 
    bool subscribe
) internal virtual
````
Registration function that can be called in an initializer, anywhere.  

Can be called repeatedly without issues.

To subscribe to the [default OpenSea curated block list](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/operator-filter-registry/#deployments), simply use `_registerForOperatorFiltering()`, without arguments.

### `onlyAllowedOperator`
```solidity
modifier onlyAllowedOperator(address from) virtual
```  
Modifier to guard a function and revert if `from` is a blocked operator.  

### `onlyAllowedOperatorApproval`
```solidity
modifier onlyAllowedOperatorApproval(address operator) virtual
```  
Modifier to guard a function from approving a blocked operator.  

### `_operatorFilteringEnabled`
```solidity
function _operatorFilteringEnabled() internal view virtual returns (bool)
```  
For deriving contracts to override, so that operator filtering can be turned on / off.

Returns true by default.

### `_isPriorityOperator`
```solidity
function _isPriorityOperator(address operator) internal view virtual returns (bool)
```  
For deriving contracts to override, so that preferred marketplaces can skip operator filtering, helping users save gas.

Returns false for all inputs by default.
